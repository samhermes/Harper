== Description ==

Halle was made for your story. A clean, refined design gives your words and photos center stage. Built for the new WordPress block editor, the possibilities are endless. Designed to take full advantage of any size screen, all you have to do is hit publish.

## Halle is Accessible

Halle is officially "Accessibility Ready," meaning that you're off to a great start to keep your content accessible to anyone who wants to consume it. Ensure that you add informative alternative text to each image you upload, and maintain a proper heading structure in every post and page. To learn more about how to create accessible content, [check out this article on make.wordpress.org](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/content/).

## Halle is Customizable

Halle includes support for custom logos, custom header background images, and custom header colors, so you can create a header that fits with your style perfectly.

*Note: The custom header colors should always maintain enough color contrast to remain readable to any user. Use the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to make sure you are still in the green.*

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Using Halle ==

= Displaying featured posts on the homepage =

Halle displays four featured posts on the homepage. The four most recent posts are used automatically, or you can apply a category named "Featured" to add posts manually. In either case, the posts will not display until there are at least four posts with featured images.

= Setting a main menu =

Halle only supports one level in the main menu, so any child menu items will not display.
