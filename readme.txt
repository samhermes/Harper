== Using Halle ==

= Displaying featured posts on the homepage =

Halle displays four featured posts on the homepage. The four most recent posts are used automatically, or you can apply a category named "Featured" to add posts manually. In either case, the posts will not display until there are at least four posts with featured images.

= Setting a main menu =

Halle only supports one level in the main menu, so any child menu items will not display.
